# R Shiny app for management data input

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an application with the purpose of allowing farmers to enter information about management events. This information could be harvest yields or type of tillage performed, for example. The app is a part of the [Field Observatory](https://www.fieldobservatory.org) project.

The app produces a .json file based on the given data. These files largely 
follow the ICASA standard for variables.

This app employs the excellent [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) package and the [Golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) framework for developing Shiny applications.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of fieldactivity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fieldactivity")
``` 
-->

You can install the app from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ottis1/fo_management_data_input")
```
## Example

To run the app, call run_app with a named argument to supply the folder to store the generated files:
```{r example}
library(fieldactivity)
#run_app(json_file_path = "~/my_json_file_folder")
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
