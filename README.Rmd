# R Shiny app for management data input

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Ottis1/fieldactivity/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ottis1/fieldactivity/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

An app for keeping track of field activity in the [Field Observatory](https://www.fieldobservatory.org) project. Built using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [Golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/), the application allows farmers to enter information about common farming events like tillage, sowing and harvest. These event data are stored in .json files, which mostly follow the ICASA standards for agricultural data.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of fieldactivity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fieldactivity")
``` 
-->

You can install the app from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ottis1/fieldactivity")
```
## Example

To run the app, call run_app with the following arguments to define the json file directory, the user database and the passphrase to the user database:
```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(fieldactivity)
run_app(json_file_path = "~/my_json_file_folder", 
        user_db_path = "~/my_user_database",
        user_db_passphrase = "password123")
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
