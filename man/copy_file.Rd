\description{
When a file (image) is uploaded through a fileInput widget, it is saved to a
temporary folder. This function copies that file to an appropriate directory
and name. The file does not have to be originally in a temporary
folder, any file path is ok. This means this function can also be used e.g.
when cloning and event and the images associated with it need to be
duplicated.

\details{
The name will be of the format 
yyyy-mm-dd_site_block_variable_name_# where # is a number (0, 1, 2, ...) to
ensure that files have unique names.
